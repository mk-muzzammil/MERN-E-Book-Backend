// Firstly setting up basic  react app folder for our admin dashboard project and also celan my project from unneccessary default code after it as i am using shadcn so install tailwind css and types of node also for shadcn installation for more assistance we can go to shadcn documentation and also we can use tailwind css documentation for more assistance i will add it from documentation of shadcn
// By the use of shacn i have copied the code of login signup and dashboard after it i have make layout of dashboard bcz we want some things static in diff pages and only middle inventory must be changing so for this i wil make a layout and the things that remain same will be kept in layout and the things that must be changed will be kept in diff comp and after i make the use of Outlet
// which help in changing the middle part of the layout and the layout will remain same and the middle part will be changed for it we have to change in our router.tsx file and add children field in the / route so that we will have acess to diff pages and we can change the middle part of the layout

// one new thing as wee see in out login and signup we will not have anything in common so we will make a layout with nothing in it just Outlet of react router dom and we will use this layout for login and signup in router.tsx
