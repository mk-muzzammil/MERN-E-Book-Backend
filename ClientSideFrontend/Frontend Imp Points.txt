So we wil make a new project of next by command npx create-next-app@latest After we will practise some of techniques how basically make routes in next app as i know when we make folders in app folder that will be our new routr and in the folder page.tsx file will be made which will be rendered when that route will be triggered 
==>so after this we will talk about static navbar that must be available in allpages so for this we wil make component of navbar outside app and then import it in the layout.tsx and then use before children so it will be in each page

==>After this we will make out navBar with icond used of fontawesome so install it with 
npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
and after it use it in our component so after this i have created my navBar and  also banner for my frontend
===>Here comes twist there are 2 types of components in nextjs client and server:server components are processed or renderd on nextjs server and after processing and fetching of data from api the html will be sent to the client component which wil be rendered on client side by default all components are server we can make it client comp by append use client to the top
