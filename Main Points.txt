================Basic Setup===============
For typescript based project initializing we will make a new foldr then npm init and after it install some devDependencies fo rtypescript typescript,ts-node,@types/node,nodemon insatll all these dep and after it we will initialize the ts congiguration file 
Command==>npx ts --init and after it make a gitignore file of rit ctrl+shift+L+P add a git ignore and of node 
npm init @eslint/config is ver imp package which will help us to identify errors in our porject must be available in every project made
====>After it i will use prettier for better formatiing of code and for setting rules i will make .prettier.json file in which i will define all my rules
====>Afte this expressjs is installed and also some dep for typescript we add npm install -D @types/express so whis must be installed
===After this i will install dotenv package npm i dotenv plus for typescript some dep npm i -D @types/dotenv
===After it i will not make src folder and make app.js file in which i will write my all express code and for server running we will have server.js our entry point in which our server runs
==> Also we wil work on a config folder which will take my configurations into count so that we will not have to change in large no of places so process.env.PORT etc we will write this in config and as in some verison of node process.env not extracted properly so we will install dotenv package which will help us to extract everything from env file easily and add it to our config folder  and after it we will make .env file in which all imp things will be kept and also in team work we will make .env.example file for partners in which they can see the imp keys that must be set but kept one thing in mind we will add wrong values of keys in .env.example bcz it must be private
